h2. 3.5.2
  
h3. Bugfixes
  * Controller#render_cell now accepts multiple args as options.

h3. Changes
  * Caching versioners now can accept state-args or options from the #render_cell call. This way, you don't have to access #options at all anymore.


h2. 3.5.1

  * No longer pass an explicit Proc but a versioner block to @Cell.Base.cache@. Example: @cache :show do "v1" end@
  * Caching.cache_key_for now uses @ActiveSupport::Cache.expand_cache_key@. Consequently, a key which used to be like @"cells/director/count/a=1/b=2"@ now is @cells/director/count/a=1&b=2@ and so on. Be warned that this might break your home-made cache expiry.
  * Controller#expire_cell_state now expects the cell class as first arg. Example: @expire_cell_state(DirectorCell, :count)@
  
h3. Bugfixes
  * Passing options to @render :state@ in views finally works: @render({:state => :list_item}, item, i)@


h2. 3.5.0

h3. Changes
  * Deprecated @opts, use #options now.
  * Added state-args. State methods can now receive the options as method arguments. This should be the prefered way of parameter exchange with the outer world.
  * #params, #request, and #config is now delegated to @parent_controller. 
  * The generator now is invoked as @rails g cell ...@
    * The `--haml` option is no longer available.
    * The `-t` option now is compatible with the rest of rails generators, now it is used as alias for `--test-framework`. Use the `-e` option	as an alias of `--template-engine`
    Thanks to Jorge Cal√°s Lozano <calas@qvitta.net> for patching this in the most reasonable manner i could imagine.
  * Privatized @#find_family_view_for_state@, @#render_view_for@, and all *ize methods in Cell::Rails.
  * New signature: @#render_view_for(state, *args)@
  
h2. 3.4.4

h3. Changes
  * Cells.setup now yields Cell::Base, so you can really call append_view_path and friends here.
  * added Cell::Base.build for streamlining the process of deciders around #render_cell, "see here":http://nicksda.apotomo.de/2010/12/pragmatic-rails-thoughts-on-views-inheritance-view-inheritance-and-rails-304
  * added TestCase#in_view to test helpers in a real cell view.
  

h2. 3.4.3

h3. Changes
  * #render_cell now accepts a block which yields the cell instance before rendering.
  
h3. Bugfixes
  * We no longer use TestTaskWithoutDescription in our rake tasks.
